	<h1>Information on Project Selene</h1>
	<br><br><h2>Project Overview</h2>
	<p>We are a team of high school students entering NASA’s CubeQuest Challenge, a challenge to design and build a nano-satellite. Our goal is to send a 6U CubeSat from Earth’s orbit to Lunar orbit, and return data randomly generated by NASA.</p>
	<br><h2>Tech</h2>
	<p>CubeSats are a method for creating cheaper, smaller
	satellites that fit into a cell measuring 10 cm on a side. Because of their compact size, they can be added as a
	secondary payload on almost any space mission, reducing total cost. Project Selene will consist of six
	10 cm&sup3; cells arranged in a 3 x 2 cell formation. Project Selene will utilize ion propulsion for the majority of its journey. Ion thrusters are very efficient but have comparatively low thrust, using a stream of ionized gas to propel the spacecraft, rather than typical propellants.
	Traditionally, ion thrusters are rather large, but recent technological advancements have allowed for ion thrusters small enough for use on a CubeSat.</p>
	<br><h2>Objectives</h2>
	<p>To participate in NASA's challenge, our spacecraft will transmit over 1000 1024-bit data packets from lunar orbit to earth. Our spacecraft will be judged
		based on the amount of data packets it can transmit without error. To achieve maximum accuracy, Selene will transmit over a large amount of time and with multiple levels of data redundancy. CubeSats, by nature, do not have much room for hardware. Because of this, we are limited on what instruments we can fit on Selene.  While
		data transmission will come first, if time, money, and space permit, we may include cameras and additional instrumentation.</p>
