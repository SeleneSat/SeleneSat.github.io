	<h1>Information on Project Selene</h1>
	<br><br><h2>Project Overview</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a team of high school students entering NASA’s CubeQuest Challenge, a challenge to design and build a nano-satellite. Our goal is to send a 6U CubeSat from Earth’s orbit to Lunar orbit, and return data randomly generated by NASA.</p>
	<br><h2>Tech</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CubeSats are small
	satellites that are comprised of up to six small 10cm&sup3; cells. Because of their compact size, they can "piggyback" into orbit around earth on a larger mission, reducing total cost. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Selene will be a CubeSat consisting of six
	10 cm&sup3; cells arranged in a 3 x 2 cell formation.
	<br><br><h2>Propulsion</h2>
	<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Propulsion, Selene will utilize the ‘Green Monoprop’ thruster produced by Busek. This thruster provides 500 mN at 230 seconds specific impulse and is fueled by the monopropellant AF-M315E (a hydroxylammonium nitrate blended with other chemicals). This propellant was developed by Edwards Air Force base as a part of GPIM, overseen by NASA Marshall. This propellent is 50% more efficient than hydrazine and is non-toxic.</p>
	
	<br><h2>Objectives</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To participate in NASA's challenge, our spacecraft will transmit over 1000 1024-bit data packets from lunar orbit to earth. <br><br>Our spacecraft will be judged
		based on the amount of data packets it can transmit without error. To achieve maximum accuracy, Selene will transmit over a large amount of time and with multiple levels of data redundancy. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By nature, CubeSats do not have much room for hardware. However, if we have enough time, money, and space left over after ensuring Selene can accomplish its primary objectives, we plan to include cameras and additional instrumentation.</p>
