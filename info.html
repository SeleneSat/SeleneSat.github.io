	<h1>Information on Project Selene</h1>
	<br><br><h2>Project Overview</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a team of high school students entering NASA’s CubeQuest Challenge, a challenge to design and build a nano-satellite. Our goal is to send a 6U CubeSat from Earth’s orbit to Lunar orbit, and return data randomly generated by NASA.</p>
	<br><h2>Tech</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CubeSats are small
	satellites that are comprised of up to six small 10cm&sup3; cells. Because of their compact size, they can "piggyback" into orbit around earth on a larger mission, reducing total cost. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Selene will be a CubeSat consisting of six
	10 cm&sup3; cells arranged in a 3 x 2 cell formation. Selene will utilize ion propulsion for the majority of its journey. Ion thrusters are very efficient but have comparatively low thrust, using a stream of ionized gas to propel the spacecraft, rather than typical propellants.
	<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, ion thrusters are rather large, but recent technological advancements have allowed for ion thrusters small enough for use on a CubeSat.</p>
	<br><h2>Objectives</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To participate in NASA's challenge, our spacecraft will transmit over 1000 1024-bit data packets from lunar orbit to earth. <br><br>Our spacecraft will be judged
		based on the amount of data packets it can transmit without error. To achieve maximum accuracy, Selene will transmit over a large amount of time and with multiple levels of data redundancy. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By nature, CubeSats do not have much room for hardware. However, if we have enough time, money, and space left over after ensuring Selene can accomplish its primary objectives, we plan to include cameras and additional instrumentation.</p>
